## 🎨 Advanced Tips

### **Maximizing Educational Impact**

1. **Integrate, Don't Lecture**
   - ❌ "This evidence teaches you about encryption"
   - ✅ "The encrypted message uses AES-256. Can you crack it?"

2. **Use Suspects as Teachers**
   - Give suspects backgrounds that naturally introduce concepts
   - Example: "Dr. Chen, a cryptographer, mentions her work on quantum encryption"

3. **Evidence as Learning Moments**
   - Each piece of evidence should teach or reinforce a concept
   - Example: A phishing email as evidence teaches red flag recognition

4. **Puzzles as Application**
   - Puzzles should require applying learned concepts
   - Example: After learning about social engineering, identify it in suspect testimony

### **Creating Memorable Narratives**

1. **Strong Opening Hook**
   - Start with a compelling incident
   - Example: "The CEO collapsed during the board meeting. Was it murder?"

2. **Escalating Tension**
   - Build complexity as players progress
   - Reveal information gradually

3. **Satisfying Resolution**
   - Ensure the culprit reveal makes sense
   - All clues should point to the solution in hindsight

### **Balancing Difficulty**

**For Beginners:**
- Linear story path
- 2-3 suspects with obvious differences
- Clear, direct clues
- Simple puzzles with hints

**For Intermediate:**
- Some branching choices
- 4-5 suspects with plausible alibis
- Mix of obvious and subtle clues
- Moderate puzzles requiring thought

**For Advanced:**
- Multiple investigation paths
- 6-8 suspects with complex relationships
- Subtle clues requiring inference
- Challenging multi-step puzzles

**For Expert:**
- Non-linear exploration
- 8+ suspects with interconnected motives
- Red herrings and misdirection
- Expert-level deduction required
